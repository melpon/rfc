	<section title="Introduction" anchor="section-1"><t>
   A JSON Web Key (JWK) is a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) <xref target="RFC7159"/>
   data structure that represents a cryptographic key.  This
   specification also defines a JWK Set JSON data structure that
   represents a set of JWKs.  Cryptographic algorithms and identifiers
   for use with this specification are described in the separate JSON
   Web Algorithms (JWA) <xref target="JWA"/> specification and IANA registries
   established by that specification.</t>

	<t>
   Goals for this specification do not include representing new kinds of
   certificate chains, representing new kinds of certified keys, or
   replacing X.509 certificates.</t>

	<t>
   JWKs and JWK Sets are used in the JSON Web Signature <xref target="JWS"/> and JSON
   Web Encryption <xref target="JWE"/> specifications.</t>

	<t>
   Names defined by this specification are short because a core goal is
   for the resulting representations to be compact.</t>

	<section title="Notational Conventions" anchor="section-1.1"><t>
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   "Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels" <xref target="RFC2119"/>.
   The interpretation should only be applied when the terms appear in
   all capital letters.</t>

	<t>
   BASE64URL(OCTETS) denotes the base64url encoding of OCTETS, per
   Section 2 of <xref target="JWS"/>.</t>

	<t>
   UTF8(STRING) denotes the octets of the UTF-8 <xref target="RFC3629"/> representation
   of STRING, where STRING is a sequence of zero or more Unicode
   <xref target="UNICODE"/> characters.</t>

	<t>
   ASCII(STRING) denotes the octets of the ASCII [RFC20] representation
   of STRING, where STRING is a sequence of zero or more ASCII
   characters.</t>

	<t>
   The concatenation of two values A and B is denoted as A || B.</t>

	</section>

	</section>

	<section title="Terminology" anchor="section-2"><t>
   The terms "JSON Web Signature (JWS)", "Base64url Encoding",
   "Collision-Resistant Name", "Header Parameter", and "JOSE Header" are
   defined by the JWS specification <xref target="JWS"/>.</t>

	<t>
   The terms "JSON Web Encryption (JWE)", "Additional Authenticated Data (AAD)", "JWE Authentication Tag", "JWE Ciphertext", "JWE Compact Serialization", "JWE Encrypted Key", "JWE Initialization Vector", and
   "JWE Protected Header" are defined by the JWE specification <xref target="JWE"/>.</t>

	<t>
   The terms "Ciphertext", "Digital Signature", "Message Authentication Code (MAC)", and "Plaintext" are defined by the "Internet Security Glossary, Version 2" <xref target="RFC4949"/>.</t>

	<t>
   These terms are defined by this specification:</t>

	<t><list style="hanging" hangIndent="3"><t hangText="JSON Web Key (JWK)">
	<vspace blankLines="0"/>
	A JSON object that represents a cryptographic key.  The members of
      the object represent properties of the key, including its value.
	</t>

	<t hangText="JWK Set">
	<vspace blankLines="0"/>
	A JSON object that represents a set of JWKs.  The JSON object MUST
      have a "keys" member, which is an array of JWKs.
	</t>

	</list>
	</t>

	</section>

	<section title="Example JWK" anchor="section-3"><t>
   This section provides an example of a JWK.  The following example JWK
   declares that the key is an Elliptic Curve [DSS] key, it is used with
   the P-256 Elliptic Curve, and its x and y coordinates are the
   base64url-encoded values shown.  A key identifier is also provided
   for the key.</t>

	</section>

	<section title="JSON Web Key (JWK) Format" anchor="section-4"><t>
   A JWK is a JSON object that represents a cryptographic key.  The
   members of the object represent properties of the key, including its
   value.  This JSON object MAY contain whitespace and/or line breaks
   before or after any JSON values or structural characters, in
   accordance with Section 2 of RFC 7159 <xref target="RFC7159"/>.  This document
   defines the key parameters that are not algorithm specific and, thus,
   common to many keys.</t>

	<t>
   In addition to the common parameters, each JWK will have members that
   are key type specific.  These members represent the parameters of the
   key.  Section 6 of the JSON Web Algorithms (JWA) <xref target="JWA"/> specification
   defines multiple kinds of cryptographic keys and their associated
   members.</t>

	<t>
   The member names within a JWK MUST be unique; JWK parsers MUST either
   reject JWKs with duplicate member names or use a JSON parser that
   returns only the lexically last duplicate member name, as specified
   in Section 15.12 (The JSON Object) of ECMAScript 5.1 <xref target="ECMAScript"/>.</t>

	<t>
   Additional members can be present in the JWK; if not understood by
   implementations encountering them, they MUST be ignored.  Member
   names used for representing key parameters for different keys types
   need not be distinct.  Any new member name should either be
   registered in the IANA "JSON Web Key Parameters" registry established
   by <xref target="section-8.1"/> or be a value that contains a Collision-Resistant
   Name.</t>

	<section title="&quot;kty&quot; (Key Type) Parameter" anchor="section-4.1"><t>
   The "kty" (key type) parameter identifies the cryptographic algorithm
   family used with the key, such as "RSA" or "EC".  "kty" values should
   either be registered in the IANA "JSON Web Key Types" registry
   established by <xref target="JWA"/> or be a value that contains a Collision-
   Resistant Name.  The "kty" value is a case-sensitive string.  This
   member MUST be present in a JWK.</t>

	<t>
   A list of defined "kty" values can be found in the IANA "JSON Web Key Types" registry established by <xref target="JWA"/>; the initial contents of this
   registry are the values defined in Section 6.1 of <xref target="JWA"/>.</t>

	<t>
   The key type definitions include specification of the members to be
   used for those key types.  Members used with specific "kty" values
   can be found in the IANA "JSON Web Key Parameters" registry
   established by <xref target="section-8.1"/>.</t>

	</section>

	<section title="&quot;use&quot; (Public Key Use) Parameter" anchor="section-4.2"><t>
   The "use" (public key use) parameter identifies the intended use of
   the public key.  The "use" parameter is employed to indicate whether
   a public key is used for encrypting data or verifying the signature
   on data.</t>

	<t>
   Values defined by this specification are:</t>

	<t><list style="symbols"><?rfc subcompact="yes"?>
	<t>"sig" (signature)</t>

	<t>"enc" (encryption)</t>

	<?rfc subcompact="no"?>
	</list>
	</t>

	<t>
   Other values MAY be used.  The "use" value is a case-sensitive
   string.  Use of the "use" member is OPTIONAL, unless the application
   requires its presence.</t>

	<t>
   When a key is used to wrap another key and a public key use
   designation for the first key is desired, the "enc" (encryption) key
   use value is used, since key wrapping is a kind of encryption.  The
   "enc" value is also to be used for public keys used for key agreement
   operations.</t>

	<t>
   Additional "use" (public key use) values can be registered in the
   IANA "JSON Web Key Use" registry established by <xref target="section-8.2"/>.
   Registering any extension values used is highly recommended when this
   specification is used in open environments, in which multiple
   organizations need to have a common understanding of any extensions
   used.  However, unregistered extension values can be used in closed
   environments, in which the producing and consuming organization will
   always be the same.</t>

	</section>

	<section title="&quot;key_ops&quot; (Key Operations) Parameter" anchor="section-4.3"><t>
   The "key_ops" (key operations) parameter identifies the operation(s)
   for which the key is intended to be used.  The "key_ops" parameter is
   intended for use cases in which public, private, or symmetric keys
   may be present.</t>

	<t>
   Its value is an array of key operation values.  Values defined by
   this specification are:</t>

	<t><list style="symbols"><?rfc subcompact="yes"?>
	<t>"sign" (compute digital signature or MAC)</t>

	<t>"verify" (verify digital signature or MAC)</t>

	<t>"encrypt" (encrypt content)</t>

	<t>"decrypt" (decrypt content and validate decryption, if applicable)</t>

	<t>"wrapKey" (encrypt key)</t>

	<t>"unwrapKey" (decrypt key and validate decryption, if applicable)</t>

	<t>"deriveKey" (derive key)</t>

	<t>"deriveBits" (derive bits not to be used as a key)</t>

	<?rfc subcompact="no"?>
	</list>
	</t>

	<t>
   (Note that the "key_ops" values intentionally match the "KeyUsage"
   values defined in the Web Cryptography API
   <xref target="W3C.CR-WebCryptoAPI-20141211"/> specification.)</t>

	<t>
   Other values MAY be used.  The key operation values are case-
   sensitive strings.  Duplicate key operation values MUST NOT be
   present in the array.  Use of the "key_ops" member is OPTIONAL,
   unless the application requires its presence.</t>

	<t>
   Multiple unrelated key operations SHOULD NOT be specified for a key
   because of the potential vulnerabilities associated with using the
   same key with multiple algorithms.  Thus, the combinations "sign"
   with "verify", "encrypt" with "decrypt", and "wrapKey" with
   "unwrapKey" are permitted, but other combinations SHOULD NOT be used.</t>

	<t>
   Additional "key_ops" (key operations) values can be registered in the
   IANA "JSON Web Key Operations" registry established by <xref target="section-8.3"/>.
   The same considerations about registering extension values apply to
   the "key_ops" member as do for the "use" member.</t>

	<t>
   The "use" and "key_ops" JWK members SHOULD NOT be used together;
   however, if both are used, the information they convey MUST be
   consistent.  Applications should specify which of these members they
   use, if either is to be used by the application.</t>

	</section>

	<section title="&quot;alg&quot; (Algorithm) Parameter" anchor="section-4.4"><t>
   The "alg" (algorithm) parameter identifies the algorithm intended for
   use with the key.  The values used should either be registered in the
   IANA "JSON Web Signature and Encryption Algorithms" registry
   established by <xref target="JWA"/> or be a value that contains a Collision-
   Resistant Name.  The "alg" value is a case-sensitive ASCII string.
   Use of this member is OPTIONAL.</t>

	</section>

	<section title="&quot;kid&quot; (Key ID) Parameter" anchor="section-4.5"><t>
   The "kid" (key ID) parameter is used to match a specific key.  This
   is used, for instance, to choose among a set of keys within a JWK Set
   during key rollover.  The structure of the "kid" value is
   unspecified.  When "kid" values are used within a JWK Set, different
   keys within the JWK Set SHOULD use distinct "kid" values.  (One
   example in which different keys might use the same "kid" value is if
   they have different "kty" (key type) values but are considered to be
   equivalent alternatives by the application using them.)  The "kid"
   value is a case-sensitive string.  Use of this member is OPTIONAL.
   When used with JWS or JWE, the "kid" value is used to match a JWS or
   JWE "kid" Header Parameter value.</t>

	</section>

	<section title="&quot;x5u&quot; (X.509 URL) Parameter" anchor="section-4.6"><t>
   The "x5u" (X.509 URL) parameter is a URI <xref target="RFC3986"/> that refers to a
   resource for an X.509 public key certificate or certificate chain
   <xref target="RFC5280"/>.  The identified resource MUST provide a representation of
   the certificate or certificate chain that conforms to RFC 5280
   <xref target="RFC5280"/> in PEM-encoded form, with each certificate delimited as
   specified in Section 6.1 of RFC 4945 <xref target="RFC4945"/>.  The key in the first
   certificate MUST match the public key represented by other members of
   the JWK.  The protocol used to acquire the resource MUST provide
   integrity protection; an HTTP GET request to retrieve the certificate
   MUST use TLS <xref target="RFC2818"/> <xref target="RFC5246"/>; the identity of the server MUST be
   validated, as per Section 6 of RFC 6125 <xref target="RFC6125"/>.  Use of this
   member is OPTIONAL.</t>

	<t>
   While there is no requirement that optional JWK members providing key
   usage, algorithm, or other information be present when the "x5u"
   member is used, doing so may improve interoperability for
   applications that do not handle PKIX certificates <xref target="RFC5280"/>.  If
   other members are present, the contents of those members MUST be
   semantically consistent with the related fields in the first
   certificate.  For instance, if the "use" member is present, then it
   MUST correspond to the usage that is specified in the certificate,</t>

	<t>
   when it includes this information.  Similarly, if the "alg" member is
   present, it MUST correspond to the algorithm specified in the
   certificate.</t>

	</section>

	<section title="&quot;x5c&quot; (X.509 Certificate Chain) Parameter" anchor="section-4.7"><t>
   The "x5c" (X.509 certificate chain) parameter contains a chain of one
   or more PKIX certificates <xref target="RFC5280"/>.  The certificate chain is
   represented as a JSON array of certificate value strings.  Each
   string in the array is a base64-encoded (Section 4 of <xref target="RFC4648"/> --
   not base64url-encoded) DER <xref target="ITU.X690.1994"/> PKIX certificate value.
   The PKIX certificate containing the key value MUST be the first
   certificate.  This MAY be followed by additional certificates, with
   each subsequent certificate being the one used to certify the
   previous one.  The key in the first certificate MUST match the public
   key represented by other members of the JWK.  Use of this member is
   OPTIONAL.</t>

	<t>
   As with the "x5u" member, optional JWK members providing key usage,
   algorithm, or other information MAY also be present when the "x5c"
   member is used.  If other members are present, the contents of those
   members MUST be semantically consistent with the related fields in
   the first certificate.  See the last paragraph of <xref target="section-4.6"/> for
   additional guidance on this.</t>

	</section>

	<section title="&quot;x5t&quot; (X.509 Certificate SHA-1 Thumbprint) Parameter" anchor="section-4.8"><t>
   The "x5t" (X.509 certificate SHA-1 thumbprint) parameter is a
   base64url-encoded SHA-1 thumbprint (a.k.a. digest) of the DER
   encoding of an X.509 certificate <xref target="RFC5280"/>.  Note that certificate
   thumbprints are also sometimes known as certificate fingerprints.
   The key in the certificate MUST match the public key represented by
   other members of the JWK.  Use of this member is OPTIONAL.</t>

	<t>
   As with the "x5u" member, optional JWK members providing key usage,
   algorithm, or other information MAY also be present when the "x5t"
   member is used.  If other members are present, the contents of those
   members MUST be semantically consistent with the related fields in
   the referenced certificate.  See the last paragraph of <xref target="section-4.6"/>
   for additional guidance on this.</t>

	</section>

	<section title="&quot;x5t#S256&quot; (X.509 Certificate SHA-256 Thumbprint) Parameter" anchor="section-4.9"><t>
   The "x5t#S256" (X.509 certificate SHA-256 thumbprint) parameter is a
   base64url-encoded SHA-256 thumbprint (a.k.a. digest) of the DER
   encoding of an X.509 certificate <xref target="RFC5280"/>.  Note that certificate
   thumbprints are also sometimes known as certificate fingerprints.
   The key in the certificate MUST match the public key represented by
   other members of the JWK.  Use of this member is OPTIONAL.</t>

	<t>
   As with the "x5u" member, optional JWK members providing key usage,
   algorithm, or other information MAY also be present when the
   "x5t#S256" member is used.  If other members are present, the
   contents of those members MUST be semantically consistent with the
   related fields in the referenced certificate.  See the last paragraph
   of <xref target="section-4.6"/> for additional guidance on this.</t>

	</section>

	</section>

	<section title="JWK Set Format" anchor="section-5"><t>
   A JWK Set is a JSON object that represents a set of JWKs.  The JSON
   object MUST have a "keys" member, with its value being an array of
   JWKs.  This JSON object MAY contain whitespace and/or line breaks.</t>

	<t>
   The member names within a JWK Set MUST be unique; JWK Set parsers
   MUST either reject JWK Sets with duplicate member names or use a JSON
   parser that returns only the lexically last duplicate member name, as
   specified in Section 15.12 ("The JSON Object") of ECMAScript 5.1
   <xref target="ECMAScript"/>.</t>

	<t>
   Additional members can be present in the JWK Set; if not understood
   by implementations encountering them, they MUST be ignored.
   Parameters for representing additional properties of JWK Sets should
   either be registered in the IANA "JSON Web Key Set Parameters"
   registry established by <xref target="section-8.4"/> or be a value that contains a
   Collision-Resistant Name.</t>

	<t>
   Implementations SHOULD ignore JWKs within a JWK Set that use "kty"
   (key type) values that are not understood by them, that are missing
   required members, or for which values are out of the supported
   ranges.</t>

	<section title="&quot;keys&quot; Parameter" anchor="section-5.1"><t>
   The value of the "keys" parameter is an array of JWK values.  By
   default, the order of the JWK values within the array does not imply
   an order of preference among them, although applications of JWK Sets
   can choose to assign a meaning to the order for their purposes, if
   desired.</t>

	</section>

	</section>

	<section title="String Comparison Rules" anchor="section-6"><t>
   The string comparison rules for this specification are the same as
   those defined in Section 5.3 of <xref target="JWS"/>.</t>

	</section>

	<section title="Encrypted JWK and Encrypted JWK Set Formats" anchor="section-7"><t>
   Access to JWKs containing non-public key material by parties without
   legitimate access to the non-public information MUST be prevented.
   This can be accomplished by encrypting the JWK when potentially
   observable by such parties to prevent the disclosure of private or
   symmetric key values.  The use of an Encrypted JWK, which is a JWE
   with the UTF-8 encoding of a JWK as its plaintext value, is
   recommended for this purpose.  The processing of Encrypted JWKs is
   identical to the processing of other JWEs.  A "cty" (content type)
   Header Parameter value of "jwk+json" MUST be used to indicate that
   the content of the JWE is a JWK, unless the application knows that
   the encrypted content is a JWK by another means or convention, in
   which case the "cty" value would typically be omitted.</t>

	<t>
   JWK Sets containing non-public key material will also need to be
   encrypted under these circumstances.  The use of an Encrypted JWK
   Set, which is a JWE with the UTF-8 encoding of a JWK Set as its
   plaintext value, is recommended for this purpose.  The processing of
   Encrypted JWK Sets is identical to the processing of other JWEs.  A
   "cty" (content type) Header Parameter value of "jwk-set+json" MUST be
   used to indicate that the content of the JWE is a JWK Set, unless the
   application knows that the encrypted content is a JWK Set by another
   means or convention, in which case the "cty" value would typically be
   omitted.</t>

	<t>
   See Appendix C for an example encrypted JWK.</t>

	</section>

	<section title="IANA Considerations" anchor="section-8"><t>
   The following registration procedure is used for all the registries
   established by this specification.</t>

	<t>
   The registration procedure for values is Specification Required
   <xref target="RFC5226"/> after a three-week review period on the
   jose-reg-review@ietf.org mailing list, on the advice of one or more
   Designated Experts.  However, to allow for the allocation of values
   prior to publication, the Designated Experts may approve registration
   once they are satisfied that such a specification will be published.</t>

	<t>
   Registration requests sent to the mailing list for review should use
   an appropriate subject (e.g., "Request to register JWK parameter: example").</t>

	<t>
   Within the review period, the Designated Experts will either approve
   or deny the registration request, communicating this decision to the
   review list and IANA.  Denials should include an explanation and, if
   applicable, suggestions as to how to make the request successful.
   Registration requests that are undetermined for a period longer than
   21 days can be brought to the IESG's attention (using the
   iesg@ietf.org mailing list) for resolution.</t>

	<t>
   Criteria that should be applied by the Designated Experts include
   determining whether the proposed registration duplicates existing
   functionality, whether it is likely to be of general applicability or
   useful only for a single application, and whether the registration
   description is clear.</t>

	<t>
   IANA must only accept registry updates from the Designated Experts
   and should direct all requests for registration to the review mailing
   list.</t>

	<t>
   It is suggested that multiple Designated Experts be appointed who are
   able to represent the perspectives of different applications using
   this specification, in order to enable broadly informed review of
   registration decisions.  In cases where a registration decision could
   be perceived as creating a conflict of interest for a particular
   Expert, that Expert should defer to the judgment of the other
   Experts.</t>

	<section title="JSON Web Key Parameters Registry" anchor="section-8.1"><t>
   This section establishes the IANA "JSON Web Key Parameters" registry
   for JWK parameter names.  The registry records the parameter name,
   the key type(s) that the parameter is used with, and a reference to
   the specification that defines it.  It also records whether the
   parameter conveys public or private information.  This section
   registers the parameter names defined in <xref target="section-4"/>.  The same JWK
   parameter name may be registered multiple times, provided that
   duplicate parameter registrations are only for key-type-specific JWK
   parameters; in this case, the meaning of the duplicate parameter name
   is disambiguated by the "kty" value of the JWK containing it.</t>

      case sensitive.  Names may not match other registered names in a

      there is a compelling reason to allow an exception.  However,
      matching names may be registered, provided that the accompanying

	<section title="Security Considerations" anchor="section-9"><t>
   All of the security issues that are pertinent to any cryptographic
   application must be addressed by JWS/JWE/JWK agents.  Among these
   issues are protecting the user's asymmetric private and symmetric
   secret keys and employing countermeasures to various attacks.</t>

	<section title="Key Provenance and Trust" anchor="section-9.1"><t>
   One should place no more trust in the data cryptographically secured
   by a key than in the method by which it was obtained and in the
   trustworthiness of the entity asserting an association with the key.
   Any data associated with a key that is obtained in an untrusted
   manner should be treated with skepticism.  See Section 10.3 of <xref target="JWS"/>
   for security considerations on key origin authentication.</t>

	<t>
   In almost all cases, applications make decisions about whether to
   trust a key based on attributes bound to the key, such as names,
   roles, and the key origin, rather than based on the key itself.  When
   an application is deciding whether to trust a key, there are several
   ways that it can bind attributes to a JWK.  Two example mechanisms
   are PKIX <xref target="RFC5280"/> and JSON Web Token (JWT) <xref target="JWT"/>.</t>

	<t>
   For instance, the creator of a JWK can include a PKIX certificate in
   the JWK's "x5c" member.  If the application validates the certificate
   and verifies that the JWK corresponds to the subject public key in
   the certificate, then the JWK can be associated with the attributes
   in the certificate, such as the subject name, subject alternative
   names, extended key usages, and its signature chain.</t>

	<t>
   As another example, a JWT can be used to associate attributes with a
   JWK by referencing the JWK as a claim in the JWT.  The JWK can be
   included directly as a claim value or the JWT can include a TLS-
   secured URI from which to retrieve the JWK value.  Either way, an
   application that gets a JWK via a JWT claim can associate it with the
   JWT's cryptographic properties and use these and possibly additional
   claims in deciding whether to trust the key.</t>

	<t>
   The security considerations in Section 12.3 of XML DSIG 2.0
   <xref target="W3C.NOTE-xmldsig-core2-20130411"/> about the strength of a digital
   signature depending upon all the links in the security chain also
   apply to this specification.</t>

	<t>
   The TLS Requirements in Section 8 of <xref target="JWS"/> also apply to this
   specification, except that the "x5u" JWK member is the only feature
   defined by this specification using TLS.</t>

	</section>

	<section title="Preventing Disclosure of Non-public Key Information" anchor="section-9.2"><t>
   Private and symmetric keys MUST be protected from disclosure to
   unintended parties.  One recommended means of doing so is to encrypt
   JWKs or JWK Sets containing them by using the JWK or JWK Set value as
   the plaintext of a JWE.  Of course, this requires that there be a</t>

	<t>
   secure way to obtain the key used to encrypt the non-public key
   information to the intended party and a secure way for that party to
   obtain the corresponding decryption key.</t>

	<t>
   The security considerations in RFC 3447 <xref target="RFC3447"/> and RFC 6030
   <xref target="RFC6030"/> about protecting private and symmetric keys, key usage, and
   information leakage also apply to this specification.</t>

	</section>

	<section title="RSA Private Key Representations and Blinding" anchor="section-9.3"><t>
   The RSA Key blinding operation [Kocher], which is a defense against
   some timing attacks, requires all of the RSA key values "n", "e", and
   "d".  However, some RSA private key representations do not include
   the public exponent "e", but only include the modulus "n" and the
   private exponent "d".  This is true, for instance, of the Java
   RSAPrivateKeySpec API, which does not include the public exponent "e"
   as a parameter.  So as to enable RSA key blinding, such
   representations should be avoided.  For Java, the
   RSAPrivateCrtKeySpec API can be used instead.  <xref target="section-8.2.2"/>(i) of
   the "Handbook of Applied Cryptography" <xref target="HAC"/> discusses how to compute
   the remaining RSA private key parameters, if needed, using only "n",
   "e", and "d".</t>

   The following example JWK Set contains two public keys represented as
   JWKs: one using an Elliptic Curve algorithm and a second one using an
   RSA algorithm.  The first specifies that the key is to be used for
   encryption.  The second specifies that the key is to be used with the
   "RS256" algorithm.  Both provide a key ID for key matching purposes.
   In both cases, integers are represented using the base64url encoding
   of their big-endian representations.  (Line breaks within values are
   for display purposes only.)</t>
